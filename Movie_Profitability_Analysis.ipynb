        "Movies have been interesting to me my whole life. Recently, I have become more interested in the movie making industry. Specifically, what makes a movie profitable. In this analysis, I will investigate several factors into what makes a movie profitable.\n",
        "\n",
        "To perform this analysis I need a good dataset. I found a downloadable .csv dataset containing movie data from TMDb from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies?resource=download) that has contains a collection of a million movies and interesting data points about each of them.  There are 24 columns, but the most important columns for this analysis are title, budget, revenue, runtime, vote average, and vote count. TMDb is a public movie database that allows users to rate movies on a scale of 0-10 which is where the vote average comes from. The runtime is in minutes, and the budget and revenue are in terms of USD.\n",

        "To explore these questions I will first get a better understanding of the data set I am working with by cleaning the data and performing some exploratory data analysis. Then, I will determine if the month a movie is released has an impact on the profitability. Next, I will try to create a model that predicts how profitable a movie will be based on some of the variables I mentioned earlier."

        "This reveals some important information about our data. First of all, it shows that the average movie is not well liked. The mean being 2.31 shows that people are pretty negative about movies. At least thats what it says at first glance. However, it is clear that most movies don't even have any votes. The fact that the median number of votes is 0 and the 75th percentile is only 1 shows that barely any movies have votes. I will address this later. In addition, I see that most movies have no revenue or budget which will severily hurt our analysis. As a result, I need to do a bit more cleaning of our dataset. Because this a public dataset, some illegitimate movies have been added, which can be seen by the fact that a movie has a run time of 144000 minutes and a movie has a revenue of 3 billion dollars which is not exactly true (although Avatar and End Game come close). To clean all of these issues, I will have to remove a substantial number of movies, but it is really the only option to conduct a legitimate analysis. I will drop anything with under 10 votes, a revenue of 0, a runtime of 0, or a budget/profit of 0."

        "Clearly, there are pretty significant differences in the amount of profit by month. This generally confirms my consumption that the best movies are released in the summer and in the winter as June and December are the top values in this chart. Let's confirm that this is not just due to random chance by conducting a TVD test on the months. We can do this by making each month a proportion on the total profit of all of the movies in the dataset. We will make a new dataframe with just the necessary values for this test. Also, we must control for the number of movies released in each month. As a result, we would assume that each month has a proportion of the total profit equal to the proportion of movies released in that month as compared to the year. For example, our null hypothesis specifically would be that each month has 1/12 of the total profit of movies if an equal amount of movies were released each month.\n",

For example, the movie studio can not predict how many reviews on TMDb, but can determine the runtime, budget, and release date. For the sake of the model, we will also assume that the studio can control to some extent how popular the movie is using focus groups, consumer analysis, etc. We must also incorporate the year in our calculation to account for inflation.

        "Clearly, the model struggles to predict the profitable of the movies. This is not completely unexpected as our data does not properly capture many of the factors that go into the profitability of a movie. I will expand on this in the conclusion section."

        "Overall, our analysis has revealed many interesting things about movies. In the exploratory data analysis, we saw just how many movies fail to be profitable. In addition, we saw that very few are highly profitable. Next, we found that when a movie is released does seem to have some impact on its profitability. While this could be due to a multitude of factors, it is important to note that random chance is not the factor. Whether it be that studios purposely release movies they anticipate to be profitable in certain months or if movies being released in certain months become more profitable because of the release timing, we know that this descrepancy is not due until random chance. In the final phase of the analysis, it became clear how hard it is to predict the profitability of movies with a multiple regression model. It was especially difficult because we limited the variables to things you would not know prior to the movies release. It is likely that a better model could be created using a more advanced model such as a random forest or machine learning model. Regardless of the models success, we learned more about the positive relationship between budget and profitability. Overall, the movie dataset was difficult to wrangle with but the insight into release month timing and profitability prediction made it well worth it."
